			If you XML not loaded correctly ( hilarious "incorrect XML" error ) - please be sure that
				<ul>
				    <li>you are using correct url</li> 
				    <li>structure of XML is really valid - just point browser to the XML file</li>
				    <li>there is no whitespaces before &lt;?xml declaration</li>
				    <li>if XML generated by server side script it send with content-type = text/xml </li>
				</ul>
			If it still not work , then you can start terrorize support team :)
		
		
		
		<h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h3>
				While working with dhtmlx component I was really frustrated by missed details in documentation, while components can provide very rich functionality, sometimes it very hard to find necessary info in existing docs - this document was born to help anyone who just started to use dhx components.<br/>Hope it will be helpful.<br/> <br/> 
				If you think that provided documentation has some error or miss critical info - please be sure to send your remarks to <a href="mailto:docs@dhtmlx.info">docs@dhtmlx.info</a><br/>

				P.S. English is not my native language ( I think it easily detectable :) ), so you must be aware of bad grammar :)
